# jsonlikeql
============
A language which let you write SQL queries with the Json like format. It has been inspired from GraphQL syntax. Its compiler is built with Galgas.

In fact, JsonLikeQL has been designed to reduce the writting of sql queries by using a high level language which looks like Json format. This query language is designed for a server-side use. That means that only a server-side program can parse a given query and execute it.
